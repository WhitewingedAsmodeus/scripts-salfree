# Scripts for Saltfree

A collection of scripts for **Saltfree**, created by Skyelar. all scripts are intended to be run from the browser console or via a userscript manager like Tampermonkey.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains various scripts, including a fully-featured **Mod Board** UI that allows you to:  

- Rocket jump  
- Drag player (Ctrl+Y)  
- Godmode toggle  
- Chatter (slow text typing in-game)  
- High contrast mode  
- Info popup  

Other scripts are standalone utilities or experiments for gameplay enhancements go figure what they are yourself, dumbass.

## ⚡ Installation / Usage

1. Open Saltfree in your browser.  
2. Open **Inspect Element** (F12) (or three dots in the top right corner, then more tools, then inspect element) and go to the **Console** tab.  
3. Copy and paste the contents of any `.js` file here, or install via **Tampermonkey**(google extension (maybe firefox too idk) if it’s a userscript.  
4. For the **Mod Board**, load it first to have access to the full UI and features.  

> **Note:** Do **not** paste all scripts at once — some scripts may conflict if run simultaneously.

## ⚙️ Tips

- Use **Ctrl+Y** to enable flying via the Mod Board.
- Use **Ctrl+[** to enable high contrast if you paste it seperatly from the modboard.
- Use **Ctrl+e** to enable free cam. (will add it to the modboard soon)
- Load scripts individually to avoid conflicts.  
- The **Chatter** feature in the Mod Board allows typing long messages with adjustable speed.
