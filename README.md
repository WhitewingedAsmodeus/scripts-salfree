# Scripts for Saltfree

A collection of scripts for **Saltfree**, created by Skyelar. Most scripts are intended to be run from the browser console or via a userscript manager like Tampermonkey.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains various scripts, including a fully-featured **Mod Board** UI that allows you to:  

- Rocket jump  
- Drag player (Ctrl+Y)  
- Godmode toggle  
- Chatter (slow text typing in-game)  
- High contrast mode  
- Info popup  

Other scripts are standalone utilities or experiments for gameplay enhancements.

## ⚡ Installation / Usage

1. Open Saltfree in your browser.  
2. Open **Inspect Element** (F12) and go to the **Console** tab.  
3. Copy and paste the contents of any `.js` file here, or install via **Tampermonkey** if it’s a userscript.  
4. For the **Mod Board**, load it first to have access to the full UI and features.  

> **Note:** Do **not** paste all scripts at once — some scripts may conflict if run simultaneously.
